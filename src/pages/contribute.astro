      You can use our open-source design system to build any website or product.
      At Canonical we are always working to improve and update it. Here are some
      ways in which you can contribute:

      <h2 slot="small">Propose a change</h2>
      <p>
        If you have found a bug on the site or have an idea for a new feature,
        feel free to <a
          href="https://github.com/canonical/design.ubuntu.com/issues/new/choose"
          >create a new issue</a
        >, or suggest a fix by creating a pull request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please provide as much information possible detailing what you're
        currently experiencing and what you'd expect to experience.
      </p>

  <Strip>
    <SplitContent>
      <h2 slot="small">Propose a new component</h2>
      <p>
        If you find that you can't design a particular functionality by using
        our existing components or patterns, we encourage you to file an issue
        in the Vanilla Github repo. You can either propose a new component or
        pattern, or suggest amends to existing ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internally, we have a working group which will look at your proposal and
        discuss whether there are alternative ways of accomplishing your goals
        with existing components, or validate your request. Once your request
        has been validated one of our designers will take ownership of this
        issue and work on providing a solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you can't find a resource or a logo, we encourage you to file an
        issue in our Github repo. You can either propose a new resource or logo,
        or suggest amends to existing ones.
