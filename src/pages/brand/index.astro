    <h2 class="p-heading--1">Our brand values</h2>
    <p>
      We believe everyone has the right to a great computing experience — and we
      also believe it should be free. Ubuntu is the result of a growing
      community, working together to provide just that. As such, the Ubuntu
      brand embodies four values:

    <div class="col-3">
      <h3>Freedom</h3>
      <p>
        Ubuntu celebrates freedom. Freedom to choose, to change, to participate.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3">
      <h3>Reliable</h3>
      <p>
        You can depend on Ubuntu. Like the people who make it, it is trustworthy
        and keeps its promises.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3">
      <h3>Precise</h3>
      <p>
        Ubuntu is crisp and clean in engineering and attitude. There is beauty
        in the precision of the process and product.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-3">
      <h3>Collaborative</h3>
      <p>
        Working together is at the heart of Ubuntu. It is the essence of
        ’humanity towards others‘.
      </p>

    <h3 class="p-heading--2">Our brand guidelines</h3>
    <p>
      Our values should be evident wherever Ubuntu is encountered, whether
      online or via traditional marketing material. If we follow these
      guidelines consistently, the brand will grow strong enough to attract
      people, encouraging them to look even more positively on the product
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      These guidelines provide everything you need to create professional
      communication materials that will build the Ubuntu brand. To help ensure
      the continued success of Ubuntu, please use them.

        <p>
          The logo is the most recognisable feature of any brand identity. The
          Ubuntu logo is striking and clear, and it represents the brand’s core
          values.

      >
        <p>
          The vibrant Ubuntu colour palette was created and evolved to ensure
          that designs convey the correct meaning, while aligning to the brand
          colours.
